## Reflection

This was a challenge provided by [Ollyo](https://ollyo.com/) for the Fresher React JS Developers post. Project goals creating a responsive image gallery which included the features of reordering, deleting multiple images, and setting a feature image.

One of the main challenges I ran into was the Drag and Drop feature. This lead me to spend some time studying the relevant DOM events.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React and Tailwind CSS, and a significant amount of JSX. I chose to use the `npm create vite@latest` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
